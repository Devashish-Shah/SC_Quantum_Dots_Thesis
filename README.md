# Characterizing Quantum Dots in Semiconductor Hetero-structures
### Bachelorâ€™s Thesis Project I (Aug'23 - Present)

The quest for the experimental realization of Quantum Processors for computation has grown to be a vast field of research in recent years, with the search for an optimal 
platform for scalable qubits having become an active area of research in the field. 
Semiconductor spin qubits and superconducting qubits are at the forefront of research in experimental quantum computing, with keen interest from academia and industry
alike. Electron (or Hole) spins in an external magnetic field are natural candidates for a quantum two-level system that can be used as a qubit. With coherent control,
spin-readout, and multi-qubit gates having been demonstrated, among other aspects, they are strong candidates for achieving scalable quantum processors.
This thesis focuses on measurements involved in characterizing gate-controlled quantum dots in semiconductor heterostructures. Particular attention is paid to the analysis
of measured data and instrumentation involved in setting up low-temperature
measurements. All measurements were done at the Silicon Quantum Computing Lab at IIT Bombay.

PS: This is the initial draft of the BTP-I report to be submitted on 06-11-23. Further sections on Pauli spin blockade and quantum dot characterization will be added without
any modification to the overall flow of the content. The final draft will be uploaded before 2nd December, 2023.
